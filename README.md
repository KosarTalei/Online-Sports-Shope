<h1>Online sports shop</h1>
<h2>Creating the static website layout<h2>

# Project overview
<p>
Sports Warehouse is a retail company that would like to start selling sports equipment online. The project will be delivered in four stages.
</p>

# Design requirements
A Photoshop file which contains the desktop design and mobile design for the website.
# Web hosting 
The company already has web hosting, which is a Linux server running Apache (v2.4+), PHP (v7.3+) and a MySQL database (v5.7+).
# Deliverables
The project will be delivered in 4 separate stages. Each deliverable will contain some practical creation of an aspect of the project along with documentation.

# Deliverable B – Static website layout
<h2>UX Web layout stream</h2>
<p>Use the provided Photoshop design to create the website home page using HTML and CSS. It will be given to the design manager for approval before it is converted to a PHP website.</p>

<h2>Section A – Implementation of the website from design concept</h2>
<p>Create the home page of the website according to the design concept provided (as a
Photoshop design file). This website must be responsive according to the design to
accommodate devices with differing screen sizes – mainly phone (e.g. ~320px wide) and
desktop (e.g. ~1000px wide) devices.
The slideshow will be implemented at a later stage using JavaScript/jQuery.</p>

<h2>Section B – Uploading the website</h2>
<a href="http://sw-sport-warehouse.epizy.com/?i=1">Click here to visit the website</a>
<h2>Section C – Testing the website</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS validation
<p>Use the W3C validation tools to validate HTML & CSS files to ensure that the
markup and styling code is clean and correct. This will help with cross-browser
accessibility.</p></li>
<li>Cross-browser testing
<p>Test the web page in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera browser</p></li>
<li>Accessibility testing
<p>Using a Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) evaluation tool.</p></li>

<p>Some other (hypothetical) potential accessibility issues user could face with the website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colour combinations that fall outside of the WCAG allowable contrast ratios can pose a major problem for
colour-blind or low-vision users. Also, the mistake of using colour as the only means of information, like adding emphasis to a word or section of a website.</li>
<li>Keyboard users use the Tab key to navigate the page
that shows them what element they are on in the page.
These indicators appear as a border or as a highlight
around the focused element, helping those with low
vision to determine where they are on the web page. It
is important that the website is coded for keyboard
navigation.</li>
<li>The search box without a visible label is an accessibility
issue for individuals with visual impairments</li>
</ul>
</ul>
